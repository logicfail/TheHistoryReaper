# TheHistoryReaper
A discord bot that is capable of deleting all messages older than a configured number of days.

## Usage
You can enable and disable history deletion in any channel by using the bot's commands.  If you make a change to a channels configuration, it will freeze the deletion process for a period of time, to allow you to fix any mistakes before messages begin getting deleted.

### Enable history deletion in the current channel or change the number of days
.reap <after_this_number_of_days>

### Disable history deletion in the current channel
.unreap
